    <h1> Reflection for 7/17!!!</h1> 
    <p>     Python was fairly easy to learn, I had trouble making a loop as well as actually drawing out my circle. 
        Python and Scratch are alittle different because for python you have to write out. I liked how you could run it everytime and see where you made the error.
        I hope we keep working with Python instead of Scratch:)
