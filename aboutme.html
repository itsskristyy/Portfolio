    <h1> Reflection for 7/17!!!</h1> 
    <p>     Python was fairly easy to learn, I had trouble making a loop as well as actually drawing out my circle. 
        Python and Scratch are alittle different because for python you have to write out. I liked how you could run it everytime and see where you made the error.
        I hope we keep working with Python instead of Scratch:) Debugging the program was alittle tough but my partner & I had gotten through it
        and actually made a square!
      </p>
      <h2>  REflection for 7/18!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
      <p> We did more python and like I understood it so it was nice:). ALso I wanna go home and sleep but I cant so that sucks. 
      Today was a good day and I learned alot about functions!! My game worked so that was nice. </p>
