    <h1> Reflection for 7/17!!!</h1> 
    <p>     Python was fairly easy to learn, I had trouble making a loop as well as actually drawing out my circle. 
        Python and Scratch are alittle different because for python you have to write out. I liked how you could run it everytime and see where you made the error.
        I hope we keep working with Python instead of Scratch:) Debugging the program was alittle tough but my partner & I had gotten through it
        and actually made a square!
      </p>
      <h2>  REflection for 7/18!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
      <p> We did more python and like I understood it so it was nice:). ALso I wanna go home and sleep but I cant so that sucks. 
      Today was a good day and I learned alot about functions!! My game worked so that was nice. </p> 
      <h3> reflection for 7/19 </h3>
      <p> Today we learned about data structure!
        A list is a way to structure all your code. You can randomize your list and make it structured. Its useful when you have a large group of numbers and want to organize it.
      All of my groups worked well together. At first we worked in groups of three and then we worked in groups of 2. These were good because they helped me when I had a problem and vise versa. </p>
